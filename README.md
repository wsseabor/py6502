### 6502 Processor in Python

This is a repo of a sort of overly explanatory codebase of a 6502 processor as it happens.
It is an ongoing project and will be added to as the days progress. This repo follows the
6502 programming manual and other helpful links that will be included below. I encourage 
anyone reading to check them out as they go along as well.

- The *[6502 programming manual](https://web.archive.org/web/20221112230813if_/http://archive.6502.org/books/mcs6500_family_programming_manual.pdf)*
- The incredible *[reference courtesy of BitWise](http://www.6502.org/users/obelisk/index.html)*
- Nick Morgan's interactive *[6502 Javascript Assembler and Simulator](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/)*
- Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendleton's *[Write your own virtual machine](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/#running-the-vm)*

The TODO list is so vast it may need it's own file so maybe later on that.
